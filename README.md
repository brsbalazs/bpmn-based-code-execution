# Demo Project Using bpmn node package
https://www.npmjs.com/package/bpmn or https://github.com/e2ebridge/bpmn

A demo project for experimenting with bpmn based code execution solutions.

Since the used package is an old one, and it is no longer being updated by developers, it has some dependency issues. To solve this I decided to use it as a local dependency, in case I have to make any updates on the source code of the library.

Launch project with an example bpmn:
1. npm install on the bpmn folder
2. npm install on the bpmn-starter-project folder


Updates on bpmn library:
 - Winston dependency version fixed to "0.7.1 - 2.4.4"
